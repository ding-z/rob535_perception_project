Matlab code for ROB 535 Self Driving Car Perception project.

Run "main_train_label_1.m", "main_train_label_2.m", "main_train_label_3.m" for network training. 

Run "main_detect.m" for detection of the testing set and generating resulting .csv files for Task 1 and Task 2.

Make sure to modify/check the first few lines of the main scripts so that directories and names of files are appropriate.

Currently using Matlab R2019b with a few Mathwork packages.
